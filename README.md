# raptor-chickens
Raptor Chickens mod for Stardew Valley
==========================================

Changes the chicken sprites to colourful raptors. Affects the sprites for white, brown, blue and void chickens + their chicks. Also modifies Shane's sprite post-marriage to turn Charlie into a brown raptor instead of a cream chicken.



*Future Features*
- Editing Shane's portrait so he is holding a raptor instead of a chicken
- Changing the 'Egg' description
- Checking if any other dialogue needs adjusting
