Raptor Chickens mod for Stardew Valley
==========================================

Changes the chicken sprites to colourful raptors. Affects the sprites for white, brown, blue and void chickens + their chicks. Attempts to modify all major chicken references in the game, including Shane's pet chicken Charlie, the purchasing pane, the descriptions of chicken eggs, and relevant dialogue.

Unless I've missed something, this mod is complete.
