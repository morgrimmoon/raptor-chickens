# raptor-chickens
Raptor Chickens mod for Stardew Valley
==========================================

Changes the chicken sprites to colourful raptors. Affects the sprites for white, brown, blue and void chickens + their chicks. Attempts to modify all major chicken references in the game, including Shane's pet chicken Charlie, the purchasing pane, the descriptions of chicken eggs, and relevant dialogue.



*Future Features*
- Editing Shane's portrait so he is holding a raptor instead of a chicken
